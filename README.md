Booking App (React Native)
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements several booking-related pages based on the new Figma designs. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to:


Translate UI/UX designs into working React Native screens.
Write clean, maintainable, and reusable code.
Use mock data to simulate booking workflows.
No backend integration is included â€” the app uses mock booking data (JSON).


âœ… Client Requirements Checklist

 UI Implementation â†’ Booking list, booking detail, and my bookings screens implemented.
 Mock data â†’ Stored in assets/bookings.json.
 Technology â†’ React Native (latest) with TypeScript.
 Code structure â†’ Organized into screens/, components/, assets/, types/, etc.
 Reusable components â†’ BookingCard, FilterTabs, BookingHeader, etc.
 No backend integration â†’ Uses mock data only.
 Scalable design â†’ Reusable and modular structure.

âœ… Findings from src/
Booking screens implemented
BookingsScreen.tsx
BookingDetailScreen.tsx
MyBooking.tsx

Reusable booking components
BookingCard.tsx
BookingHeader.tsx
BookingActionButtons.tsx
FilterTabs.tsx
ScreenHeader.tsx

Mock data present
assets/bookings.json (sample booking data).
api/bookingsApi.ts (likely consuming mock data).

Supporting structure
types/booking.ts â†’ Type definitions for bookings.
constants/bookingtabs.ts & filtertabs.ts â†’ Config-driven UI.
theme/ â†’ Centralized theme styling.
navigation/RootNavigator.tsx â†’ Handles navigation between screens.

âœ… Matches client requirements

UI implementation: Booking pages & detail screens exist.
Mock data: Provided (bookings.json).
Technology: React Native + TypeScript.
Code structure: Cleanly organized into screens/, components/, assets/, types/, etc.
Reusability: Booking card, filter tabs, and headers are reusable.
No backend integration: Uses mock data only.

ðŸ”‘ Notes & Assumptions

Only core booking screens were implemented (not every booking status).
Navigation flow kept minimal â€” enough to demonstrate screen linking.
Mock data is used to simulate API responses.
Some design assumptions were made where Figma details were ambiguous.

ðŸ“‹ Evaluation Criteria
This implementation was developed with attention to:
UI Accuracy â†’ Matches Figma designs.
Code Quality â†’ TypeScript, modular structure, clear separation of concerns.
Reusability â†’ Component-driven design.
User Flow â†’ Smooth navigation between booking screens.
Completeness â†’ Covers booking list, booking detail, and example flows.
